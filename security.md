# Security

Security is important, and because security is important to people and users,
you need to pay attention as well and make it a priority in your
project. Embrace it.

A project should be judged based on how it acts on security problem much more
than the mere fact that the problems appeared the first place. Even the best
run projects will have occasional hiccups, but projects that do not take care
of and handle their security vulnerabilities in a proper and responsible way
will lose users' trust. And without trust, what is your project?
