# Debugging

As a maintainer of a project, you will be one of the few people in the world
that knows a lot, maybe most, of the internals workings of your code.

Having that intimate knowledge of internals and general architecture makes you
a suitable person for debugging hairy and difficult problems. The problems that
are not easy to digest or understand after the first few rounds of questions
have been answered.

In an Open Source project that has a lot of different persons involved, it
only makes sense that the individual that can do a particular job the fastest
and most efficient way, actually performs it. This makes debugging, and then I
mean difficult and time-consuming source code researching, a task that ends
up on your plate more often than on the less experienced ones.

If you learn to enjoy the challenge of debugging, you set yourself up to
appreciate Open Source maintaining more.

The older a project gets. The less time you get to spend on developing new
stuff and the more time you spend debugging existing code. Maybe older
projects also get more complicated problems that take even more effort and
time to debug. Due to legacy and things that were established years ago and
maybe not so convenient and clever anymore.
