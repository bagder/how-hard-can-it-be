# Security issues

Taking care of security issues can be a significant undertaking. See
[security](../security.md).

In my daily Open Source work, I find that when someone reports a suspected
security problem, assessing the possibility, risk and impact of the issue can
take a significant effort and time.

Is it a security problem? If it is a security problem, what is the impact, the
severity and how should it be fixed?

Security problems should be addressed as quickly as possible to reduce the
risk of harm to existing users out there that run the vulnerable versions. It
is also important that the knowledge of a security problem and the work on the
fix are done behind closed doors. When the fix is written, reviewed, tested
and verified you can announce the vulnerability and the associated fix to the
world. The idea of course being to minimize the impact for vulnerable users
and give them a change to upgrade to a fixed version once the bad guys out
there also get told about the flaw and therefore can start to exploit it.
