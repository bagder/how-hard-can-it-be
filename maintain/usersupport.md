# User support

Make no mistake. Your project will be judged and graded, not only how well the
code runs when people execute it, but also based on how well you treat your
users when come to you to ask questions.

A user asking for help is a person who have deemed your project worthy to use,
or at least potentially use if they get it working the way they intend it to
use it. Your response to this cry for help can be what makes this a happy user
that sticks around forever and turns into a contributor, or someone who gives
up and moves on to do something else.

Respond within a decent time in a friendly and accurate manner.

This can become time consuming work and may certainly pull you away from being
able to work on that cool new feature you write spend your evening coding on, but
in general it could be considered more important to help and please users
to use the existing product and feature set than to expand it. You helping a
user now could make that same user able to help the next user asking an almost
identical question next week.

Of course, all user support should be feedback on how documentation can or
should be improved so that users in the future can find the information on
their own rather than asking for it. Even if you will never completely be able
to avoid questions simply because for many users, asking is quicker and easier
done than searching and reading documentation.
