# World monitoring

Keeping track of what is going on in the world outside of your project is
important. It allows you to get a feel for where the world is going and what
users are expecting and anticipating.

Learning from what competitors do and implement and what their users ask for
or complain about can indirectly work as feedback for you.

Keeping an eye on what is going on in the standards organizations for things
that are related to your project is another way to "put your ear to the
ground". It gives you a sense of what people are working on and hope to see
use for going forward.

Creating surveys and forms for users and fans to fill in and answer, can be
yet another way for you to learn what people want and where they think the
world is going. You probably do not want to move your project in a direction
that is not aligned with the world and your users.
