# Mailing list admin

The tradition of doing most communication in an Open Source project over email
and mailing lists is probably a habit that is dying, but as I am an old
dinosaur I have always made sure my Open Source projects have mailing lists
and associated archives for them so that you can look up mails afterward and
link back to them etc.

Someone then needs to make sure those lists are hosted somewhere, that they
run properly with as little downtime as possible, that there is a decent
amount of spam countermeasures and that the list can properly handle new
people signing up or leaving.

I have had to learn a lot about mail servers and mailing list software.
