# Website admin

In a small project, and most Open Source projects are small, you will end up
having to maintain the website as well. I have wrestled with web server
configuration files, hosting providers, HTML tags, understanding CSS classes
and learned more details about HTTP security response headers than I ever
wanted and of course none of that was actually related to the projects I
worked in.

An Open Source project needs a dedicated website. It is not enough to exist on
Gitlab, GitHub or the likes. Those are excellent source hosting and management
services, but they do not replace the need for a proper website. A website
that explains what the projects is, what it does, where the documentation is
and how to get started using etc.

And someone needs to make sure it runs fine and that the contents can be read
and understood.
