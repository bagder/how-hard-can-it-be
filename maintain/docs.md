# Write documentation

As a maintainer of a project, you are one of the people who knows a lot, maybe
most, of the internals workings of the code. That helps when answering
questions and even more when documenting the project and its workings.

Documentation is of course there to describe how your product or service works,
and to cover as many details as possible so that users and developers can find
answers to their problems by reading rather than asking questions that take
time for other humans to respond to.

By extending and polishing the documentation, you ideally set yourself up to
offload work from your future self from questions.

Providing clear and accurate documentation is hard and I have learned that you
can spend a lot of time on that. What you think is a clear description might
not read well in others' minds.

Documentation also needs to be easy to find (in) and it needs to be presented
in a tasteful or maybe even attractive way.

I always end up spending a large amount of my time writing documentation.
