# Days are 24 hours for all of us

How do you get time to spend on Open Source?

Everyone has equally many hours per day to work with. It is what we do with
those hours that counts.

Some of us take longer than others to write code or to come up with solutions
to problems.

Some of us spend hours of the day on other things than Open Source. It may be
computer games, socializing with friends, hobbies or sleeping in.

When people ask me how I get time to work on Open Source I usually answer that
I do less of everything else: less sleep, no computer games, less TV and to
some extent I sacrifice social life. Yet I have a family, two kids and I
maintain a life. I will not claim I master this, but I think I manage all
right.

Personally, I have also been able to take advantage of my two extra super
powers:
1. an ability and *obsession* to keep pondering and gnawing on problems in my
   head even when away from my keyboard. This can drastically shorten the time
   needed in front of the screen the next time I get to it.
2. I am decent at multi-tasking and being productive on something even if I
   only have a few minutes at it every now and then. Some people want a
   certain amount of time to "get into flow". I can usually be productive
   within minutes. This is super useful if all you have is ten minutes every
   now and then spread out over many days. Like when having (small) kids or
   when trying to support your Open Source project during breaks at work.
