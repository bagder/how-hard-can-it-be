# Money

The world is to a large part driven by economic and financial incitements. We
live in a capitalistic society. We need money to pay for food and a roof over
our heads. Open Source maintainers also need money.

## Volunteers make things different

## Companies pay for features

Being in the core team of a popular Open Source project will lead you to
getting requests to do development for compensation within the realms of that
project. You will learn that companies are at times willing to pay you to get
their desired features added in your project so that they can use it - and
they know that paying a core developer is possibly the best way to get a
feature into a project's mainline code.

You will however rarely see a company offer to help with compensation for
generic bug fixes or other infrastructure things or improvements in the
project. And if you do, you know you are not in a small project anymore!

## Getting donations is hard

## You do not get what you pay for
