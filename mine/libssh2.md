# libssh2

In late 2006, I wanted to add SCP and SFTP support to curl. I investigated the
library situation for SSH support and I found that there existed two similar
Open Source library contenders for this purpose, confusingly similarly named
too: libssh2 and libssh.

I wanted the SSH library to work with a non-blocking API to suit curl properly,
so I reached out to both the SSH library projects I had found and asked them
about their current support and how they viewed the future and offered to work
on providing such API and functionality myself. I thought the by far most
promising and friendly response came from **libssh2**, so I made my choice.

In November 2006 we started to add support for SCP and SFTP to curl based on
libssh2, and at the same time I started contributing improvements in the
libssh2 project. In particular to make sure the API could be set to and behave
in a non-blocking way.

libssh2 was founded by Sara Golemon in 2004 and she was still the lead
developer when I joined the project but I soon became a co-maintainer and when
Sara changed jobs in 2007 she was prohibited to contribute to the libssh2
project anymore and I became almost the primary maintainer.

I am still a maintainer of the libssh2 project in 2022, but I try to keep my
activities to a minimum. Others do the real work there now.

In OpenSSF's [criticality score](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score)
update in early 2021 where they rank how critical Open Source projects are to
the world, they put libssh2 as #3222 out of 102,507.
