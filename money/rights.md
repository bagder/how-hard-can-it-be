# Rights to the money

Who has the right to the money donated to and owned by the project?

In a project with no formal leadership and no one gets paid to work on it,
that ends up getting some [donations](donations.md), there is room for
friction and unhappiness when money is spent. While getting donations might be
hard, spending donations can be even harder.

Communication, consistency, transparency and fairness could be guiding
principles and of course money that a project has received should be spent on
activities that benefit the project in one way or another.

In many projects, there will be an implied and assumed right given to the most
active and maybe founding members to have more to say about these
matters. Also, like in any group with humans, some will speak louder and make
their opinions made clear in a stronger way.

Be open about how the money is spent and why. Involve project members in the
discussion about where and how to distribute the funds.
