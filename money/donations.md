# Getting donations is hard

Getting *some* donations is probably not that hard, but getting donations
received in a project to a sufficient level so that the money can actually be
used to something constructive is difficult.

You will find that donations are primarily done by individuals, and with
rather small amounts that require a huge following for the amount to build
up. Companies who could be able to pay more rarely do that via donations or
sponsorship. Companies prefer to have invoices to pay. Selling something might
be easier to get company money.

Making a living out of donations is rare.

## Receiving money

Most Open Source projects start out as a one-person hobby thing that ideally
grows into multiple contributors, but still only as a collection of random
humans under a name on the Internet. Receiving money from companies and
individuals when not having a legal entity can be tricky.

Fortunately, there are several collectives and foundations you can join these
days that will help your project receive and hold on to money for the sake of
your project. Usually, at the price of a percentage of the revenue.

## Sponsor an individual

Many projects are run by a single person and many such invidual persons accept
donations.

As a donor or sponsor, thinking about the difference between sponsoring a
person and a project can be worthwhile exercise. In many cases there might not
be a distinct difference, but in others there might.

Donating to a single person will probably help further that person's efforts
into their projects, which might push the project further that you think they
should work on. But donating to a single person will also help that human to
easier buy food or raise their family with that funding, while donating to a
project often makes that a slightly trickier endeavor due to reasons explained
above.
