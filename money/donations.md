# Getting donations is hard

Getting *some* donations is probably not that hard, but getting donations
received in a project to a sufficient level so that the money can actually be
used to something constructive is difficult.

You will find that donations are primarily done by individuals, and with
rather small amounts that require a huge following for the amount to build
up. Companies who could be able to pay more rarely do that via donations or
sponsorships. Companies prefer to have invoices to pay. Selling something
might be easier to get company money.

Making a living out of donations is rare.

## Receiving money

Most Open Source projects start out as a one-person hobby thing that ideally
grows into multiple contributors, but still only as a collection of random
humans under a name on the Internet. Receiving money from companies and
inviduals when not having a legal entity can be tricky.

Fortunately, there are several collectives and foundations you can join these
days that will help your project receive and hold on to money for the sake of
your project. Usually, at the price of a percentage of the revenue.
