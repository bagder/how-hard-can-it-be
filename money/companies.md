# Companies pay for features

Being in the core team of a popular Open Source project will lead you to
getting requests to do development for compensation within the realms of that
project. You will learn that companies are at times willing to pay you to get
their desired features added in your project so that they can use it â€“ and
they know that paying an already established core developer is possibly the
best way to get a feature into a project's mainline code.

You will however rarely see a company offer to help with compensation for
generic bugfixes or other infrastructure things or improvements in the
project. If you do, you know you are not in a small project anymore.
