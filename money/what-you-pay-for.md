# You get what you pay for

That is how the common idiom goes, right? The meaning being that the price of
something equals its quality. But does it?

Open Source projects are often provided at zero price and yet some of the most
reliable and highest quality software products we know of are Open Source. You
can build highly advanced and yet reliable things and applications based
solely on code you pay zero dollars for.

Time is never free and you also need computer equipment and maybe other
infrastructure to run the Open Source so no one gets away completely without
paying anything, but you can avoid paying the authors of the software and yet
get to use high quality code without breaking any laws.

Even if you can get away without paying anything to any creator of Open
Source, it might be worth considering hiring someone from the project or
getting a support contract for it, to drastically reduce the amount of time
you waste getting lost by not understanding how to use the code most
efficiently etc.

Maybe you do not extract the optimal value from the project by not paying
anyone knowledgeable and therefore the product you build with it does not come
to its fullest potential.
