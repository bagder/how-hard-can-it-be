# Bug Bounty

If possible, consider offering a bug bounty for your project. They usually
work so that security researchers who find and report security vulnerabilities
in your project are rewarded. Preferably with real money.

By offering money to researchers, you will "buy their eyeball time" for a
little while. Many of those will otherwise simply move on and rather spend
their limited time and energy on other projects that *do* offer rewards.

## The Bug Bounty Paradox

By offering monetary rewards for *finding* security problems, you might find
yourself in a situation where you pay for the finding but all the developers
who are left to fix the problems are unpaid volunteers. You must be aware of
and acknowledge this imbalance, as it may alienate contributors. Maybe you can
find a way to combat it?

Still, in my experience from having worked with well over a hundred security
flaws detected in my own Open Source projects, finding the problem is usually
the tough part. Once the problem has been identified and brought into the
light of day, actually fixing it is nine out of ten times a rather straight
forward action.
