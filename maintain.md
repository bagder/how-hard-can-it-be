# Maintain

A *maintainer* is someone who maintains, develops and looks after an Open
Source project. Usually with enough rights to be allowed to push changes to
the necessary repositories.

In large projects, there can be numerous different roles with different people
assigned to them. In smaller projects, there are often just a small set of
people that do everything that needs to be done in an Open Source project. In
many projects there is only one maintainer.

And projects need so much more than just code to strive and succeed.

Maintaining a project can include *at least* the following roles:

 * [BDFL](maintain/bdfl.md)
 * [Security issues](maintain/security.md)
 * [Release management](maintain/release.md)
 * [Website admin](maintain/website.md)
 * [Mailing list admin](maintain/mailinglist.md)
 * [Patch reviewing](maintain/review.md)
 * [User support](maintain/usersupport.md)
 * [Blogging about it](maintain/blogging.md)
 * [Debugging](maintain/debugging.md)
 * [Merging](maintain/merging.md)
 * [Feature development](maintain/features.md)
 * [Write documentation](maintain/docs.md)
 * [Event planning](maintain/events.md)
 * [Getting stickers](maintain/stickers.md)
 * [Doing talks](maintain/talks.md)
 * [World monitoring](maintain/worldmonitor.md)
