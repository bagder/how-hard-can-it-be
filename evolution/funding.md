# Funding

Open Source has grown and spread over these decades and is now used by almost
everyone and everywhere. This has made it easier to get funding for projects.

Over the last thirty years there have been a significant change in Open Source
awareness, in Open Source companies and also pure funding for open projects
run outside of companies.

Now, there are numerous companies doing nothing but Open Source, something
which was basically unheard of back in the 1990s.

Now you can get to work for companies and work on Open Source all day. You can
get support deals and contract development to do Open Source from companies in
ways that were not possible before.
