# Production

There are more, better and larger Open Source projects now than ever before.
Over the last three decades, the general knowledge about Open Source has
increased a lot, and developers in general are now more likely to do Open
Source and to have contributed to Open Source than they were in the past.

The way we produce Open Source has also changed drastically. We use different
and better tools, we have better services provided for free or at low cost, we
have to a large degree switched to other languages and there are indications
that the licenses used are changing over time.

We all have much better Internet connections that allow us to communicate
better and more. We have more elaborate communication services. The use of
computers is more widespread, and thus the potential of more contributors.
