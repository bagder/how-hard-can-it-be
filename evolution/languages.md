# Languages

There has been a boom and explosion in programming languages, and then
subsequently in Open Source projects written in those languages.

These new languages bring new people into Open Source, they offer different
features and often ways to produce more and safer code faster. Many of them
lower the bar for newcomers that help drive Open Source growth.

The most popular languages of today used for Open Source did not even exist as
dreams three decades ago.
