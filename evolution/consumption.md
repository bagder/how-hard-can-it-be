The use of Open Source software has never been more widespread and accepted
before. Virtually every software company in existence now use Open Source in
products and infrastructure. Open Source is easy to use and the modern way to
make software reusable. It does not die and vanish when individual products or
companies fade away.

Open Source has penetrated every aspect of the software industry and there is
no longer any areas that are considered "too important" to let Open Source
in. That includes defense systems, airplanes and interplanetary space
missions.
