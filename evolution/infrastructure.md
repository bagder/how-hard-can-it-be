# Infrastructure

Here I mean the infrastructure needed and provided to *make* Open Source.

An Open Source project typically only needs a few fundamentals:

1. a website
2. an issue tracker
3. source code version control and management
4. communication channels

With those, a project can flourish. Sure, you can add other services too to
make things even greater, but good projects have succeeded with only these 4.

In all those four areas, infrastructure has greatly improved over the last
three decades.

## Website

You no longer have to run a physical machine and configure your own configs to
make a web server function. You still can if you want, but these days there
are countless of ways to use others' machines and others' services with
virtual machines and co-hosting what not. At very low costs.

It is even usually easy and cheap to register a domain for this to get your
personal name on the site.

## Issue tracker

These days many (most?) projects go with a service provider that hosts and
offers whole selection of project management services in the same place in an
integrated fasion. GitHub and Gitlab being two popular and known providers.

Getting a good and productive issue tracker up for your project used to be
complicated. It is not anymore.

## Version control

RCS was replaced by CVS which was replaced by Subversion for a short while
until the distribution version control systems really took off.

Today, git is really the version control champion and we are all so much
better off now than we ever were before.

Distributed development has never been done with better tools than now.

## Communication

When I started working in Open Source, mailing lists and IRC were just about
the only two options.

Since then, the world has exploded with different communication options. The
current challenge is rather that there are so many options and alternatives
that you risk drowning or maybe that your users get spread out with just a
tiny fraction using each available platform.

The chat and video platforms of today are beyond what we could even dream of
in the Open Source projects of the 1990s.
