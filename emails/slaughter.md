# I will slaughter you

A small portion of the emails I receive are not "funny" or pleasant at all.
They can be direct threats of violence or death. This of course because curl
and libcurl are also used by a fair share of bad guys.

Malicious persons and software that attack and exploit users can also use curl
and subsequently, every now and then you can find traces of curl where it was
part of a setup where people were hurt, hacked or scammed.

Some victims of such attacks can find traces of curl, which again has my name
in there somewhere and then they send their threats in my direction.

In early 2021 for example, I received an email with a subject line like this:

    Subject: I will slaughter you

The email contained a series of screenshots with "proofs" of my alleged attack
and in a following email chain the confused sender said things like:

    I do not care. Your bullshit software was an attack vector that cost me a
    multimillion dollar defense project.

    Your bullshit software has been used to root me and multiple others. I lost over
    $15k in prototyping alone from bullshit rooting to the charge arbitrators.

    I have now since October been sandboxed because of your bullshit software so
    dipshit google kids  could grift me trying to get out  of the sandbox because
    they are too **** poor to know shat they are doing.

I of course had no idea what this person was talking about and I responded to
him saying so. I ended up reporting this to the police where I live because I
read it as a genuine threat.

Many months later, the person email me again and apologized.
