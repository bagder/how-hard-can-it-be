# How I respond

I am sorry to say that I usually do not respond at all.

The distance in technical knowledge and awareness of how things are glued
together and work between the person sending the email and me is usually so
great I do not know how to overcome it.

Years ago I used to reply and try to explain for the other side that I am but
the main author of an Open Source library one of these giant corporations are
using, but it backfired so many times I have realized it often just makes the
user *more* upset than before. They often do not believe me since my code is
in their product I must know then so when I do not help them out I am even
more in the receiving end of their desperation. They think I am trying to
duck for or avoid the problem when I should in fact just help them.

I do occasional exceptions, like if the user seem to be the victim of a scam
or is in a truly vulnerable situation.
