## Fix the gamepad

    Subject: Drift gamepad on PS5

    Hello.
    In the updated version of the Ghost of Tsushima for the PlayStation 5
    console, there was a problem, the control of the left stick is too
    sensitive and therefore the character itself moves. Drift compensation
    in game settings doesn't help.
    Correct it if possible. Thanks.

## Possible bug

    Hi. I didn't find other way to contact with PoB developers, so writing
    here – please redirect this letter to proper people.
    I think i found bug
    when i'm using nightblade support (with dual strike for example) while
    having varunastra equipped (2 obviously), it doesn't add any crit multi
    to my main skill while under elusive effect. (elusive checked at
    Configuration) Supported Skills can only be used with Claws or
    Daggers looks like nightblade don't recognize that my varunastra counts
    as all weapon types i swapped varunastras for Rive claw for test, and
    it's working flawlessly.
