# The book

I decided to split the book into a number of separate sections based on topic,
and then talk about a set of specific items, questions or concerns maybe in
each such topic.

1. Experience. Stories from half a dozen Open Source projects I have created
   or joined and spent a significant time and energy in.
2. Start. Some words and advice about getting started with Open Source.
4. People. I have learned something about working with humans after a while.
6. Project. Lessons and insights about project specific things.
5. Money. Conclusions about the monetary side of Open Source.
3. Source. The code is certainly key in a project and there are clues for us there.
7. Security. A really important area that we must never ignore.
8. Maintain. What is it and what does it take to "maintain" a project?
9. Evolution. Let me take you with you on a little journey and show how Open
   Source has developed.
10. Life. Can you be a successful Open Source maintainer *and* have a life at
    the same time?
11. Emails. A collection of "interesting" questions and feedback that I received
    over the years.
