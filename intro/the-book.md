# How to read

This book is divided into eleven separate sections based on topic, in which I
talk about a set of specific Open Source items, questions or concerns.

1. [Experience](../mine.md). Stories from half a dozen Open Source
   projects I have created or joined and spent a significant time and energy
   in.
2. [Start](../start.md). Some words and advice about getting started with Open Source.
3. [People](../people.md). I have learned something about working with humans after a while.
4. [Project](../project.md). Lessons and insights about project specific things.
5. [Money](../money.md). Conclusions about the monetary side of Open Source.
6. [Source](../code.md). The code is certainly key in a project and there are clues for us there.
7. [Security](../security.md). A really important area that we must never ignore.
8. [Maintainer](../maintain.md). What is it and what does it take to be a project *maintainer*?
9. [Evolution](../evolution.md). Let me take you on a little journey and show how Open
   Source has developed.
10. [Life](../life.md). Can you be a successful Open Source maintainer *and* have a life at
    the same time?
11. [Emails](../emails.md). A collection of "interesting" questions and feedback that I received
    over the years.
