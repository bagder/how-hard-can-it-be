# Paid developers ask unpaid volunteers to do work

The more your product and code is used by people and companies around the
world, the more they (people at said companies) will come back and demand
answers or bug fixes (often rudely, see above) and similar and mention how
they are short on time or whatever. Even though in many cases these persons
have the problem at their daytime paid jobs, while you work on your project on
your spare time.
