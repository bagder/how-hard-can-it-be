# Contributors are mostly male white westerners

Getting a fair share of women or people that are not white men from a western
country to participate in your project is hard.

As an Open Source project I think we should strive to wipe out any kind of
treating people differently depending on some particular characteristics, be
it sex, religion or whatever. The harsh reality is that the Open Source world
is still consisting mostly of these stereotypes. I am one of them, I am no
exception.
