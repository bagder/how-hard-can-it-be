# Contributors will not stick around

Hardly anyone will stick around. People contribute a lot, but few actually
care for the "big picture" and stay around to work with the project for more
than a short while to get their changes incorporated. You should more or less
expect that the person who just brought you the most excellent bug fix will
not be around anymore once you have pushed their patch.
