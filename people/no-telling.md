# People use your code without telling

Getting your code into Linux distributions or into other commercial unix
distributions or companion packages etc is great fun but happens without you
getting to know about it, and you also rarely get any comments or feedback
from those users.

Heck, even other application authors or product manufacturers will just get
your stuff and use it and not tell you (and neither are they obliged to of
course). Until things do not work as they thought...
