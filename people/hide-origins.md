# People hide their origins

Even employees at large tech companies or producers of high volume devices
that rely on your Open Source project will show up asking questions and
demanding actions, using seemingly anonymous or with personal-looking email
addresses. It is a common practice to avoid using the company domain in emails
to mailing lists to avoid too easily revealing their association.

Sometimes this may of course be because said employee is actually working on a
side project on their spare time and truly is an individual asking for help, but
in other cases it is done to hide for competitors that company X uses this
project, to make the user avoid comments (or hostility) from others about
company X but also to avoid it appearing as if company X that is making a lot
of money of their product looking for freebies (which they might be).

Other reasons for hiding your true name and identify include people who feel
uncertain that they will be treated badly or at least "unequal" if they
do. Perhaps the contributor is a representative of a minority group, such as
one with a disability, a follower of an unusual religion or a woman in what is
a seemingly male-dominated group - which might only appear male-dominated
because the other women already present are using male-sound aliases...
