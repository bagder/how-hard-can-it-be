# People assume everything is well motivated

I repeatedly get reports and issues filed from people who have questions about
stuff in the code or about certain behavior. They assume that since it is done
in a special way in the code it is done so by careful research and precise
coding resulted in those choices and thus they do not complain or ask about it
to us and instead write angry blog posts somewhere else.

The truth is that development is to a large degree evolutionary and unless
someone reports a problem with a particular solution, it often sticks the way
it was done when it was first made to work. Even though it might not be
perfect and perhaps over time turns out to be a rather half-baked way. Many
are also the fixes that are "temporary" and then just never get around to get
modified or fixed. And why change something that works?

Not to mention that most projects also have a list of things they would like to
change or fix one day but that nobody ever gets around to actually doing.
