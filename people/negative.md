## Negative feedback

Writing and participating in Open Source you can get quite a lot of feedback
due to the open nature of what you are doing and ease with which people often
can find you and direct their comments to you and your community.

Out of all the feedback you will get to a typical project, not even 10% will
be positive. Most of the things and features that just work will go on without
comments while you will hear a lot from bugs and flaws or things people do not
understand as easily. Being an Open Source project maintainer means you should
grow thick skin to endure a fair amount of criticism.

It is good that you get to know about the problems, then you can work on
fixing them!
