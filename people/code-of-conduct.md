# Code of Conduct

You should add a code-of-conduct document to your project as early as
possible.

Similar to how you want software documented to describe what behavior to
expect from the code, the code-of-conduct documents the expected behavior from
people participating in your project.

Yes, for most people and in most projects, these written rules are totally
obvious and unnecessary to spell out because a major of people have a sense for
them by default. The document is still there and is useful to make it clear
for newcomers and casual observers that your project is a nice place where
people are expected to behave according to these standards. Having them
spelled out removes the need for people to try to get a sense for unwritten
rules and concepts that can be difficult to figure out until someone actually
tries to break one of those invisible lines. Such "invisible lines" are also
tricky to keep consistent and unbiased, especially over time.

Experience also says that it is way easier to set these rules early on and
live by them from the start than it is to bring in code-of-conduct discussions
many years later when there is a huge developer community and the arguments
around specific phrases in such a document can be time and energy
consuming. Time and energy you might rather spend on other things.
