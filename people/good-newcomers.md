# Newcomers can be awesome

There are lots of clever people in the world. Just because a person never
contributed before does not mean the person is not really bright and
smart. Sometimes you get the best patches and help from people you never met
before and who moves on the next day never to come back. The Open Source
community can be a warm and fuzzy place!
