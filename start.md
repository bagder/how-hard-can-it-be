# Start

There has never been a better time to get started with Open Source or to
release your project as Open Source than right now. There are better and more
*free* and no-cost infrastructure available than ever before. There are
probably also more Open Source developers out there in a community that never
has been this large before.

Now is a perfect time to get into Open Source.
