# Distributors absorb reports

Linux (and other sorts of) distributions that ship your product will at times
"absorb" bug reports since users tend to report them to their distro instead
of the upstream project, and not all distros excel at passing on the bug
reports to and cooperate with the upstream project (us).

Therefore, some legitimate bugs are reported by users but you never see them
and they sit lingering and slowly rotting in some else's bug tracker.
