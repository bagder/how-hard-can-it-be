# Given enouh eyeballs, all bugs are shallow

This is said to be [Linus' Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_law).
Meaning that with enough testers and people looking at the code, all bugs and
quirks will be found and erased.

Of course, more eyes on the code will help you find and fix more bugs, but you
must not fool yourself into believing that just because you have a very large
user base that automatically means that a lot of people have actually read the
code. Very few users ever read the code of any project. Including popular
ones.

People rather follow each other, meaning the network effect of "they use that
product so then I shall as well" is explaining usage much more than the
absense of bugs.

This said, rearely used and impopular projects probably are reviewed and
scrutinized *even less*. If 0.2% of users read a piece of the code, at least
more users make a few more readers.

All bugs could in theory eventually be found. But only if you stop adding new
features and you have a large amount of users *for a very long time*.
