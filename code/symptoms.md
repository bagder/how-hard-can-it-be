# Many bug-fixes address symptoms

In line with that, most first version patches and fixes you get from
contributors (who by their nature most often are not long timers in the
project) will fix the symptoms of bugs rather than the actual causes. Digging
up the real underlying cause and its reason can be a lot of work and by nature
people avoid "a lot of work" if at all possible.
