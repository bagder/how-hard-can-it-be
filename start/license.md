# On license

If you create your own project, you get a chance to select a license for it.

Make sure you select a known, public and established existing Open Source
license for your project. It should have been vetted by the [Open Source
Initiative](https://opensource.org/). Never, ever, create your own.

Select a license that matches what you want your project and code to be and
how it should be allowed to be used or not. Whatever your choice lands on, you
can be certain that there will sooner or later be someone with opinions about
the one you picked who would prefer you use another.

It might not be easy to change the license down the line.
