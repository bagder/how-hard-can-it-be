# Attracting developers

There is only one main and foolproof way to attract users (who then might
become contributors and developers): make an Open Source project that is
attractive and compelling. Make a product people want and do it in a project
that makes contributors want to come and to stay around and help out.

Contributor prospects will initially come for the main features and functions
of your project, but they will not stick around and help out if the "softer"
areas of the project are not also "attractive" enough. What license is
used. How high the bar is set for getting started to contribute. But also what
language is used – both programming and spoken. And when it comes to spoken or
written language, it means both which language as in English or Spanish and in
how the specific language is used in issues and discussions and more.

Attracting contributors to a project is about marketing, but you cannot
lie. You really must deliver on what you claim about your project. By making
your project appear as nice as possible – because it is – you increase the
chances of finding users and contributors.
