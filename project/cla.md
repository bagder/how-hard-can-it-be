# Contributor License Agreement

*A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) defines the terms under which
intellectual property has been contributed to a project, typically software
under an Open Source license.*

In practice, the use of a CLA in Open Source projects is to make contributors
sign over rights to their contribution to the party which with the agreement
is made. Typically, that is a company or organization that owns and runs the
project in question.

Projects want those signed over rights so that they can do what they please
with the code, even when it contains contributions from random contributors.
This often includes making special versions of the software under a different
license. Normally, such re-licensing of code requires that all copyright owners
agree to it. However, enforcing CLA ensures that you own everything or have the
signed-over rights, removing such obstacles from doing so.

For the individual contributor, a CLA is a often considered a red flag:

1. Signing over rights to someone requires you to trust that entity to
   do the right thing with your contributions in the future.
2. It adds friction and complications since your contributions will not
   be accepted before paperwork and legalities have been handled
   successfully.
3. It makes the product unequal in the sense that contributors to the project
   cannot do the same things with it as the entity can that collects the
   CLAs. It will be considered unfair and imbalanced to some.
