# If not alive, it is dead

An Open Source project that does not update its web site, has not done any
commits in the source code repositories or modified other resources within a
given time period will appear dead to the rest of the world.

A project that is not updated, is in this state because the people in the
project do not care enough or do not have the time or energy required to keep
the project afloat. If people do not manage to care enough to keep things
up-to-date, the project will be considered dead. Yes sure there are
exceptions, but not many. We all look at other projects like this, we must
realize that others look onto our projects the same way.

There is of course no exact number or scientific answer here to what exact
time interval a project needs to update with, but a living project does not
have to think about that.
