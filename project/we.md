# The project is we, not "I" nor "you"

**How** you communicate in and about Open Source projects is important and
well greatly affect how you and your work is perceived. Clear communication
is important because you are working with humans, and in many cases people who
do not have English as their primary language.

When speaking of *your* project, even when you are the only single person who
contributes to it for the moment, try to refer to it as *our* project. The
project is a communal effort and we are a team that makes it. Sure, that team
is sometimes or even often just you, but by being inclusive in your language
you make it clear and obvious that everyone is invited to be a part of the
project.

When contributing *to* a project, avoid speaking of doing things to *your*
project or use phrases like "*you* might want to do this" etc. As a
contributor to a project, you are lining up to become a member of that
community and therefore you are part of it. You do not sent improvements to
*them*, so send them to *us*. *We* might want to do this in *our* project. You
will find that the receiving end of your help also appreciates that you are
part of the solution, not just an outsider throwing in things.
