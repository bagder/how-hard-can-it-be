# Documentation is never good enough

If there is too little documentation or badly phrased, people will not find the
answer there.

If there is too much written on a subject people will not find the answer since
there is too much written and they are only looking for the answer to their
tiny, tiny question.

If there is a FAQ, the exact question the user is looking for is not answered
there.

Heck, even if the documentation is perfect (in your mind), lots of people will
just mail and ask anyway since they believe that is a faster way to get the
accurate answer. Or they do not believe the documentation. Or they for some
reason decide that the perfect online documentation must be out-of-date.
