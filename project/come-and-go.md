# People come and go

As a project maintainer, you learn that people truly come and go all the time.

Without knowing where from or how they found you and your project, you can
find an awesome and well-written improvement provided to the project on a
rainy Tuesday morning from a name you have never seen before. Other times, you
will find the project completely deserted and that you are the only one to
have done any changes to it for an extended period of time.

The contributors who flocked to the project just a while ago and who helped
with so much stuff, added good code and helped answer questions from new
users just suddenly vanish.

The low barrier to entry is also a low barrier to exit. People get bored, they
change jobs, they find spouses, they get kids, they switch to a competing
project - in a sense, every other Open Source project in existence is a
competitor as in they also want the time and energy from contributors and
every contributor only have their limited amount of time and energy to spend
on Open Source. If you are unlucky, they spend their precious time in another
project.

Sometimes people will leave your project in the most inconvenient moment. We
can only pick up the pieces and move on.
